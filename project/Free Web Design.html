			<p>Some web designers charge a flat rate per page, most designers in the USA will 
			charge $100 - $200 per page. This pricing is usually for basic static brochure web 
			sites that do not require a lot of custom features. The per page price may go down 
			(with a bulk discount) depending on the number of pages you need. How many free 
			Orlando websites do you think there are? If you have a Web Site Designed for you from 
			scratch it can take 6 month to a year. The reason it may take so long is they are very
			time consuming and because of this, they are very expansive. Cost can average $120 an
 		    hour and can take up to fifty hours for one page.</p>
			<p>We will offer you a Free Web Design up to 5 pages with any Web Maintenance agreement
  			with us.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Look for the label: The EPA's ENERGY STAR label quickly identifies 
				energy-efficient appliances and electronics. </li>
				<li>Automate it: Automated technology to control electricity and air conditioning 
				can translate into big savings. Start with a programmable thermostat. </li>
				<li>Get the facts: Most people don't like to read their owners' manuals, but manuals 
				are full of energy saving ideas. Read your manual to ensure you are taking full 
				advantage of all the energy-conservation capabilities available with your electronic
			    devices. </li>
				<li>Unplug it: Many electronic devices, such as televisions, DVD players, stereos, 
				computers, and cell phone battery chargers, continue to draw a small amount of power even when turned off or not in use. Unplugging them, versus only turning them off. </li>
				<li>Centralize it: Make it easy to turn off electronics when they are not in use 
				by plugging them into power strips. Power strips make it easy to turn off multiple 
				electronics all at once.</li>
